### Sets
- A set is a collection of objects, e.g., $S = \{3,2,5,8,9\}$
- In math, sets are unchanging
- in CS, sets manipulated by algorithms can grow, shrink, or change over time. We call them <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">dynamic sets</span> 
- Dynamic sets we will study:
	- Arrays & Matrices
	- Stacks & Queues
	- Linked lists
	- skip lists
	- binary search trees
	- hash tables
	- disjoint sets
	- graphs

### Dynamic set operations
- Operations can be grouped into two categories:
	- Queries, which only return information
	- modifying operations, which change the set
