5-tuple:
$$M=<Q, \Sigma, δ, s, F>$$
Process each symbol step-by-step

Example:
- 4 states: 0,1,2,3
- instructions: a,b
	- a: advances to the next state
	- b: stays on the same state
- therefore, any set with 3 or more $a$s will be part of the language
Any set that is part of the language is called a regular set
