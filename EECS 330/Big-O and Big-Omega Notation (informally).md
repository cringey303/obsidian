O-notation characterizes an upper bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function
- It says that a function grows no faster than a certain rate.
- This rate is based on the highest-order term.
- eg $7n^3+100n^2-20n+6$ is *$O(n^3)$ since the highest order term is $7n^3$, therefore that is the fastest it can grow

$\Omega$-notation characterizes the lower bound of the asymptotic behavior
