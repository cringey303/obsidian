Relationships:
- in practice, majority connect to entities
- Maximum cardinality
	- many-to-one (N:1)
	- one-to-many (1:N)
	- one-to-one (1:1)
	- many-to-many 
		- an entity of either set can be connected to many entities of the other set
- Minimum Cardinality
	- zero (partial participation)
	- one or more (total participation)
	- E.g. Faculty members teach courses
		- each faculty member may teach zero, one, or multiple courses
		- each course must be taught by one faculty member

- Formally: ER Model
	- Entity-Relationship model

- Sub-classes
	- subclass = special case = fewer entities = more properties
	- example: engineers are a type of employee
		- every engineer is an employee, not every employee is an engineer
		- in addition to all employees, engineers have special 'clearence' class
		- use triangle with 'is a' triangle
			- top points to superclass
	- only the root entity set has a key, which serves for all entities in the hierarchy

- Weak Entity Sets
	- A weak entity is an entity that does not have a global key attribute
	- Must use key from entity set above + their weak entity key
	- Example: Players on a basketball team
		- player key: team name + jersey #![[Screenshot 2026-01-27 at 13.07.48.png]]
