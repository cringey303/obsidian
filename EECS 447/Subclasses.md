- Sub-classes
	- subclass = special case = fewer entities = more properties
	- example: engineers are a type of employee
		- every engineer is an employee, not every employee is an engineer
		- in addition to all employees, engineers have special 'clearence' class
		- use triangle with 'is a' triangle
			- top points to superclass
	- only the root entity set has a key, which serves for all entities in the hierarchy![[Screenshot 2026-01-27 at 13.03.05.png]]
