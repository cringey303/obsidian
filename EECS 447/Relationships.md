- in practice, majority connect to entities
- Maximum cardinality
	- many-to-one (N:1)
	- one-to-many (1:N)
	- one-to-one (1:1)
	- many-to-many 
		- an entity of either set can be connected to many entities of the other set
- Minimum Cardinality
	- zero (partial participation)
	- one or more (total participation)
	- E.g. Faculty members teach courses
		- each faculty member may teach zero, one, or multiple courses
		- each course must be taught by one faculty member
