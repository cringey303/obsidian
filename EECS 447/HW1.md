I would combine the two entity sets into a single set with attributes if we don't need to know the attributes about the other. For example, if you just need to know the name of the President of a Studio but not anything else about the President, then just change the President to an attribute of Studios. This would work if Studios only had one President.
Same goes for the other way around where you have Presidents and you just need to know what Studio they run. This would work if Presidents only had one Studio.
