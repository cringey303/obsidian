- Avoid redundancy
	- saying the same thing in multiple different ways
	- wastes space and **encourages inconsistency**

- Limit the use of [[Weak Entity Sets]]
	- unnecessary complexity
	- instead, try to create a unique, artificial ID

- Don't use an entity set when an attribute will do
	- An entity set should satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
		- it is more than the name of something *or*
			- store more information about something
		- it is the "many" in a many-one or many-many relationship.
